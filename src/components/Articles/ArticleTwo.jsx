                                Figuring out how much coverage you need is one of the most important parts of

                                Generally, it's a good idea for drivers to get as much liability coverage as they can
                                afford. Adding comprehensive and collision coverage is a good idea, but the amount
                                of insurance you should get depends on your car's value, too. </p>

                                earn you discounts on your coverage, like whether you have any accidents or
                                violations on your record, whether youâ€™re a full time student, and if your car is
                                equipped with features like an anti-theft device or GPS tracker.

                                Youâ€™ll also set your coverage amounts â€” called limits â€” when you apply for
                                insurance. Itâ€™s generally a good idea to have higher coverage limits, even though
                                adding more coverage will affect how much you pay for car insurance. Youâ€™ll also
                                have to choose deductible amounts for your comprehensive and collision coverage.
                                When you get a quote online or use a car insurance calculator, some optional types
                                of coverage may automatically be included that you donâ€™t actually want or need.
                                For example, if you're a member of AAA and you already have roadside assistance,
                                you don't need to pay extra to add it to your car insurance policy.
                                As you shop for insurance, be sure to look carefully at whether there are any add-
                                ons you can remove.

                                It's a good idea to get quotes from a few different insurance companies before you
                                choose a policy. You should also have an idea of how much you can afford to pay for
                                coverage before you start shopping.

                                You should look for the insurance company that offers you the most protection and
                                the best customer service at the lowest rates.

                                Once youâ€™ve compared your quotes and picked an insurance company that you feel good about, itâ€™s time to get covered.
                                When you buy a car insurance policy, youâ€™ll set a start date for when your policy will
                                start, and youâ€™ll pay your first premium.
                                <br />

                                Youâ€™ll typically receive proof of coverage and some sort of welcome package from
                                your insurer, with information about how to access your account and where to see
                                your ID cards or declarations page.

                                If youâ€™ve been shopping for car insurance to replace a current policy, wait until after
                                your new coverage is in place before you cancel your old policy. You want to make
                                sure you donâ€™t leave any gaps in your coverage.

                                To do this, set the cancellation date of your old policy and the effective date of your
                                new policy on the same day. Insurance policies begin and end at 12:01 AM on a
                                given date, so you donâ€™t have to worry about having a full day of overlapping
