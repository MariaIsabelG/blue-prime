                            <p className='leading-relaxed'>Renters insurance is financial protection for a tenant and their personal belongings.
                                There are three categories of coverage that make up a renters insurance
                                policy: personal property coverage, personal liability coverage, and loss-of-use
                                coverage. Renters insurance is a relatively cheap insurance product, costing an
                                average of $15 a month. And although it’s cheap, renters insurance can offer
                                thousands of dollars in protection.</p>
                            <p className='leading-relaxed'>
                                Renting is on the rise, but according to the Insurance Information Institute only 37%
                                of renters have renters insurance. It’s a common myth that landlords will insure
                                renters belongings (they won’t), or that renters insurance isn’t worth it. Your
                                landlord might require you to buy renters insurance, but even if they don’t it’s still a
                                good idea to get a policy. Your landlord will have their own insurance to protect the
                                physical building you are living in, but that insurance will not extend to you or your
                                personal property.
                                If you’re a renter living paycheck to paycheck, or you’re saving up to buy a house,
                                you’re likely living on a budget with little leeway in your finances to replace
                                everything you own in the event of unexpected damages. Renters insurance is a
                                highly cost effective, affordable investment to keep you and your possessions
                                protected.</p>

                            <br />
                            <p className='leading-relaxed'>Renters insurance is made up of three different categories of coverage. Each
                                category offers a different type of protection. Your renters policy will protect
                                you from a variety of different covered perils.</p>

                                normally pay for meals. For example, if there is a fire at your apartment and
                                it needs to be repaired, your loss-of-use coverage will cover the cost of a

                                the cost of your meals. Your loss-of-use coverage will even cover the cost of
                                gas if you’re driving more because you are now living further away from

                                    protection against terrorism at no cost. But today, you’d
                                    need to pay an extra cost to receive coverage, and even
                                    then, it would only cover damages in your apartment, not
                                    to the rest of the building, unless your landlord or property
                                    owner paid for separate terrorism coverage.</li>
                                <li><span className="font-bold">Other exceptions: </span>While renters insurance may cover
                                    losses to items stolen from your car, it won’t cover your
                                    vehicle; that’s what your auto insurance is for. And while it
                                    may protect items you’ve borrowed from someone else if
                                    they become damaged in your apartment, your policy won’t
                                    automatically cover the property of a roommate. They’d
                                    need to buy their own renters insurance to cover their
                                    property. Alternatively, roommates can purchase a joint
                                    renters insurance policy. If you choose to do this, however,
                                    remember that the payout in the event of a claim will be
                                    split between you both. Renters insurance also won't cover
                                    a lost security deposit.</li>

                            <br />
                            <p className='leading-relaxed'>If some of your belongings exceed your policy’s limits or sublimits, you can
                                add additional coverage to your policy to make sure your valuables are
                                protected. Additionally, you can add coverage for perils that are not covered
                                in your policy, like certain natural disasters. This additional coverage is called
                                an endorsement, and you can usually add endorsements to your policy
                                whenever you want — it doesn’t have to be at the time of purchase. Below
                                are common endorsements people add to their policies:</p>

                                <li><span className="font-bold">Scheduled property endorsement:</span> Increased coverage
                                    limits for specific valuable items, like a wedding ring</li>
                                <li><span className="font-bold">Earthquake endorsement:</span>Coverage for personal
                                    property and loss-of-use caused by an earthquake</li>
                                <li><span className="font-bold">At-home business endorsement:</span> If you make more than
                                    $2,000 a year from an at-home business, your basic renters
                                    insurance policy will not cover your business equipment.
                                    You can add an at-home business endorsement to extend
                                    coverage to things like your work laptop.</li>

                            <h2 className="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold">What to do before buying renters insurance</h2>
                            <br />
                            <p className='leading-relaxed'>Take an inventory of everything you own and add it all up. The average
                                renter owns $20,000 worth of personal property, but many apartment
                                dwellers underestimate the value of their stuff. Itemizing your belongings will
                                give you an idea of how much insurance you need.
                                <br />
                                And like any other insurance coverage, be it life, auto, health or otherwise,
                                know the type of coverage you’re seeking. Shop around, compare different
                                plans and insurance companies, and weigh your deductible versus
                                your premium to see where you can get the best coverage at the lowest
                                price.
                                <br />
                                You should also ask insurance companies about discounts they offer — many
                                will offer discounts for safety features like smoke alarms or deadbolt locks.
                                But on the other hand, if you own certain pets or breeds of dogs that
                                increase your risk of property damage, your rates could be higher.
                                Depending on the breed, you could even be denied insurance coverage.
                                Consider these factors when you’re shopping around.</p>

                            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold">Replacement cost vs. actual cash value</h3>
                            <br />
                            <p className='leading-relaxed'>There are two types of renters insurance policies you can choose from, and
                                which you choose will determine how you will be paid out in the event of a
                                claim.</p>
                            <br />
                            <ul className="list-disc ml-10 leading-relaxed">
                                <li>A replacement cost policy covers the price of replacing
                                    your items. If your laptop is stolen, your payout covers the
                                    cost of a similarly priced computer. Between the two, this
                                    policy costs more, but pays out more.</li>
                                <li>An actual cash value policy replaces items at their
                                    depreciated value. So, if your laptop was a decade old, your
                                    policy would pay you out according to its current value. If
                                    that’s not enough for a new laptop, you’d need to pay the
                                    difference at your own expense.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold">Named perils vs. all risk</h3>
                            <br />
                            <p className='leading-relaxed'>In addition to choosing between an actual cash value or replacement cost
                                policy, there are also two types of policies when it comes to covered perils.</p>

                            <br />
                            <ul className="list-disc ml-10 leading-relaxed">
                                <li>Named perils policies, only cover damage or theft stemming from specific scenarios named in the policy.</li>
                                <li>All risk policies, cover every kind of peril except any
                                    exceptions named in the policy, like earthquake damage.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br />
                            <p className='leading-relaxed'>You should talk to your insurance company to decide which policy works best
                                for your situation. After you take your home inventory, you should have a
                                good idea about how much your possessions cost and what you can afford to
                                pay to replace out of pocket. Named peril policies are considerably less
                                expensive than all risk policies, so consider this before making a decision,
                                especially if you live in an area of the country that doesn’t experience
                                extreme weather.</p>
